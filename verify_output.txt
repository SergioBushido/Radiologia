Sorted Order (Should be: User 1, User 4, User 2, User 3):
User 1 (No Block) - BlockPts: 0, Shifts: 5
User 4 (No Block, High Shifts) - BlockPts: 0, Shifts: 10
User 2 (Small Block) - BlockPts: 1, Shifts: 5
User 3 (Big Block) - BlockPts: 10, Shifts: 5
SUCCESS: Logic prioritizes low block points correctly.
